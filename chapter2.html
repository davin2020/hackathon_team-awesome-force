        <h4>SAFE-PLACE VISUALIZATION</h4>
        <p>
            The truth is, your brain and body often can’t tell the difference between what’s really happening 
            to you and what you’re just imagining.  Safe-place visualization is a powerful stress-reduction technique. 
            So if you can successfully create a peaceful, relaxing scene in your thoughts, your body will often respond 
            to those soothing ideas. <br>
            Before you begin the exercise, think of a real or imaginary place that makes you feel safe and relaxed. 
            If you have trouble thinking of a place, think of a color that makes you feel relaxed, such as pink or baby blue. 
            Just do your best.

        <h4>CUE-CONTROLLED RELAXATION</h4>
        <p>
            Cue-controlled relaxation is a quick and easy technique that will help you reduce your stress level and muscle 
            tension. A cue is a trigger or command that helps you relax. In this case, your cue will be a word, like “relax” 
            or “peace.” The goal of this technique is to train your body to release muscle tension when you think about your 
            cue word.<br>
            Before you begin, choose a cue word that will help you relax.

        <h4>Safe place visualization</h4>
        <p>
            This first exercise will ask you to identify how you value ten different components of your life using the Valued 
            Living Questionnaire. As you read each component, ask yourself how important each of these areas is to your life—regardless 
            of how much time or effort you now put into fulfilling the needs of that area.

        <h4>IDENTIFY YOUR HIGHER POWER … AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL MORE POWERFUL</h4>
        <p>
            At some point in life, we all feel hopeless or powerless. We’ve all experienced unfortunate situations during which we 
            felt alone and needed strength.Having faith in something special during times like these can often help you feel connected 
            to a bigger purpose in life. And remember, your faith doesn’t have to involve God if that’s not what you believe in. 
            Some people only put their faith in the goodness of the people they love. Yet basic beliefs like these are often powerful 
            enough to help people find the strength and comfort to lead happy, healthy lives.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Connect to Your Higher Power</b><br>
            Use the following questions to help you identify your beliefs and to identify some ways in which you can strengthen and use 
            your beliefs on a regular basis:

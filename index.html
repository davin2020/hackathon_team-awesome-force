    <!-- 
    Tutorial Followed - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/lets-build-a-firebase-chat-app-using-vanilla-javascript-4baf877d9f49

    Issues - its  unclear in the tutorial which code snippets go in which file index.html or app.js - so currntly nothing is getting saved to db. Plus i had to do extra work to setup the Realtime DB in Firebase

    Chrome dev Console shows error - app.js:21 Uncaught TypeError: firebase.database is not a function
    at app.js:21

                All those strategies are simply pathways into deeper pain, offering only temporary relief.
                Note the strategies you use and their costs - and add any costs that you can think of on your own.
